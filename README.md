# birthdate-calendar
birthdate calendar for angular material using momentjs
This directive has the neccesary elements for a birthdate picker, a simple input for year that allows 100 as max age, a grid with the months, 
and a calendarday grid for days.

The only that requires to work fine this directive is adding a $on event on your controller.
